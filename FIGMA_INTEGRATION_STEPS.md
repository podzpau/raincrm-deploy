# Figma â†’ RainCRM Integration Steps

## Method 1: Do It Yourself (Immediate)

### Step 1: Export from Figma
1. Install "Figma to Code" plugin in Figma
2. Select your component/screen
3. Choose "HTML + Tailwind CSS" 
4. Copy the generated code

### Step 2: Paste into RainCRM
1. Create new file: `app/views/shared/_your_design.html.erb`
2. Paste the Figma-generated HTML
3. Replace static text with Rails variables:
   ```erb
   <!-- Before (from Figma) -->
   <h2>John Doe</h2>
   
   <!-- After (Rails integration) -->
   <h2><%= user.full_name %></h2>
   ```

### Step 3: Use Your Component
```erb
<%= render 'shared/your_design', user: current_user, deal: @deal %>
```

## Method 2: Share with Claude (For Help)
